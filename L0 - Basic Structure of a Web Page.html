    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>Hello! I'm Hemavathi K, a passionate and dedicated MCA graduate with a strong <br>foundation in web development, software engineering, and IT. My journey into<br> technology started with a deep curiosity about how websites and digital solutions shape<br> our daily lives. This curiosity quickly turned into a passion for coding, problem-solving,<br> and creating impactful software solutions.
